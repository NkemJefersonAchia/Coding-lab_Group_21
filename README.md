We created a hospital data monitoring and archival system, which involves two main tasks:

Archival Script: Prompt the user to select a log file (heart rate, temperature, or water usage) to archive.We moved the selected log to an archive folder with a timestamp and create a new empty log for monitoring.

Analysis Script: Prompt the user to choose a log file and then analyze it by counting device occurrences, tracking first/last entries, and appending the results to a report file.

We also ensure proper error handling, file management, and data analysis using Linux commands like mv, grep, etc. The project was successfully  submitted on GitHub, with a full repository including scripts and documentation.
